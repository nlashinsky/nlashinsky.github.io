Welcome to Nick Lashinsky's website and blog - a weirdo who studied physics, worked in sales to learn how to build businesses, and then moved to Silicon valley to continue the adventure. I like to write about product, startups and people. 

Background: I moved to Silicon Valley from NY, and have worked in both non-VC backed and VC backed startups. I like to argue. But I love to learn and build stuff.
