Welcome to Nick Lashinsky's website and blog - a weirdo who studied physics, worked in sales to learn how to build businesses, and then moved to Silicon valley to continue the adventure to learn how to build amazing software products peoople love.  Software products and experiences that will actually change how we do things, like learn and work, forever. I like to write about product, startups and people. 

Background: I moved to Silicon Valley from NY, and have worked in both non-VC backed and VC backed startups. I like to argue. But I love to learn and build stuff.

I love meeting new people in person, especially those with very different perspectives or opinions than my own. Let's have a cup of coffee sometime.
