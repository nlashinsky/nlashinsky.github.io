Hi, I'm Nick Lashinsky, welcome to my blog. 


I studied physics, engineering, but have primiarily worked in hands-on and analytical growth functions at various startups, both venture and non-vc backed. I chose to move to Silicon Valley because I love working with people who think optimistically about the future, technology and business. I'm passionate about building products people love and fast-growing, sustainable businesses on top of them. I like to write, think and talk about product development, startups, economics and people. 

While I like a good argument, I try really hard to listen and process, and I highly value opinions when they come from people with diverse life experiences. I love meeting new people in person, especially those with very different perspectives or opinions than my own. Let's have a cup of coffee sometime.
